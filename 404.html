<h1 style="margin-top: 2em;">CrossFit Atlanta Is Relocating</h1>


<p>As of March 31, 2025, CrossFit Atlanta is temporarily closing its doors while we search for a new location. During this indefinite hiatus, we will not be offering classes.</p>


<p>Our Ninja Warrior Birthday Parties are also on pause, but we look forward to bringing them back as soon as possible.</p>

<p>For inquiries, please email Travis Harkey at <a href="mailto:travis@crossfitatlanta.com">travis@crossfitatlanta.com.</a></p>


<p>We are conducting a moving equipment sale. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR1Z5f--Dmt-BCC0kaewFKjc6Ffi0YOrIPunOHvyXOog-ZmKMJ82HjUCigEVF--lmwweGGEwo65VewN/pubhtml">Click here</a> for the current inventory list as there are still plenty of good deals left.</p>

<p>Thank you for nearly 20 years of unwavering support. The community we've built together has been the heart of CrossFit Atlanta, and we are deeply grateful for the relationships and memories we've shared. We look forward to returning, though we do not yet know when or where.</p>
